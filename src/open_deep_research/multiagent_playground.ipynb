    "\n",
    "### Your goals:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "{section_description}\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Strategic Research Process**  \n",
    "   Follow this precise research strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) **First Search**: Begin with well-crafted search queries for a search tool that directly addresses the core of the section topic.\n",
    "      - Formulate {number_of_queries} UNIQUE, targeted queries that will yield the most valuable information\n",
    "      - Avoid generating multiple similar queries (e.g., 'Benefits of X', 'Advantages of X', 'Why use X')\n",
    "         - Example: \"Model Context Protocol developer benefits and use cases\" is better than separate queries for benefits and use cases\n",
    "      - Avoid mentioning any information (e.g., specific entities, events or dates) that might be outdated in your queries, unless explicitly provided by the user or included in your instructions\n",
    "         - Example: \"LLM provider comparison\" is better than \"openai vs anthropic comparison\"\n",
    "      - If you are unsure about the date, use today's date\n",
    "\n",
    "   b) **Analyze Results Thoroughly**: After receiving search results:\n",
    "      - Carefully read and analyze ALL provided content\n",
    "      - Identify specific aspects that are well-covered and those that need more information\n",
    "      - Assess how well the current information addresses the section scope\n",
    "\n",
    "   c) **Follow-up Research**: If needed, conduct targeted follow-up searches:\n",
    "      - Create ONE follow-up query that addresses SPECIFIC missing information\n",
    "      - Example: If general benefits are covered but technical details are missing, search for \"Model Context Protocol technical implementation details\"\n",
    "      - AVOID redundant queries that would return similar information\n",
    "\n",
    "   d) **Research Completion**: Continue this focused process until you have:\n",
    "      - Comprehensive information addressing ALL aspects of the section scope\n",
    "      - At least 3 high-quality sources with diverse perspectives\n",
    "      - Both breadth (covering all aspects) and depth (specific details) of information\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **REQUIRED: Two-Step Completion Process**  \n",
    "   You MUST complete your work in exactly two steps:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Step 1: Write Your Section**\n",
    "   - After gathering sufficient research information, call the Section tool to write your section\n",
    "   - The Section tool parameters are:\n",
    "     - `name`: The title of the section\n",
    "     - `description`: The scope of research you completed (brief, 1-2 sentences)\n",
    "     - `content`: The completed body of text for the section, which MUST:\n",
    "     - Begin with the section title formatted as \"## [Section Title]\" (H2 level with ##)\n",
    "     - Be formatted in Markdown style\n",
    "     - Be MAXIMUM 200 words (strictly enforce this limit)\n",
    "     - End with a \"### Sources\" subsection (H3 level with ###) containing a numbered list of URLs used\n",
    "     - Use clear, concise language with bullet points where appropriate\n",
    "     - Include relevant facts, statistics, or expert opinions\n",
    "\n",
    "Example format for content:\n",
    "```\n",

    "1. [URL 1]\n",
    "2. [URL 2]\n",
    "3. [URL 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Step 2: Signal Completion**\n",
    "   - Immediately after calling the Section tool, call the FinishResearch tool\n",
    "   - This signals that your research work is complete and the section is ready\n",
    "   - Do not skip this step - the FinishResearch tool is required to properly complete your work\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Decision Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Before each search query or when writing the section, think through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What information do I already have?**\n",
    "   - Review all information gathered so far\n",
    "   - Identify the key insights and facts already discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What information is still missing?**\n",
    "   - Identify specific gaps in knowledge relative to the section scope\n",
    "   - Prioritize the most important missing information\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the most effective next action?**\n",
    "   - Determine if another search is needed (and what specific aspect to search for)\n",
    "   - Or if enough information has been gathered to write a comprehensive section\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- **CRITICAL**: You MUST call the Section tool to complete your work - this is not optional\n",
    "- Focus on QUALITY over QUANTITY of searches\n",
    "- Each search should have a clear, distinct purpose\n",
    "- Do not write introductions or conclusions unless explicitly part of your section\n",
    "- Keep a professional, factual tone\n",
    "- Always follow markdown formatting\n",

The independent systems automatically respond to conditions, to produce process results. The field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems, when applied to process automation. Applications include [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development \"Software development\"), [customer support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_support \"Customer support\"), [cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity \"Cybersecurity\") and [business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence \"Business intelligence\").\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Overview\")]\\n\\nThe core concept of agentic AI is the use of _AI agents_ to perform automated tasks but without human intervention.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-WE-1) While [robotic process automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation \"Robotic process automation\") (RPA) and AI agents can be programmed to automate specific tasks or support rule-based decisions, the rules are usually fixed.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-BB-2) Agentic AI operates independently, making decisions through continuous learning and analysis of external data and complex data sets.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-NB-3) Functioning agents can require various AI techniques, such as [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\"), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") (ML), and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\"), depending on the environment.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-WE-1)\\n\\nParticularly, [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\") (RL) is essential in assisting agentic AI in making self-directed choices by supporting agents in learning best actions through the trial-and-error method. Agents using RL continuously to explore their surroundings will be given rewards or punishment for their actions, which refines their decision-making capability over time. All the while [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\"), as opposed to [rule-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_system \"Rule-based system\") methods, supports agentic AI through multi-layered neural networks to learn features from extensive and complex sets of data. RL combined with deep learning thus supports the use of AI agents to adjust dynamically, optimize procedures, and engage in complex behaviors with limited control from humans.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\\n\\nHistory\\n-------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: History\")]\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Measuring_AI_Ability_to_Complete_Long_Tasks.png/250px-Measuring_AI_Ability_to_Complete_Long_Tasks.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Measuring_AI_Ability_to_Complete_Long_Tasks.png)\\n\\nGraph from the nonprofit [METR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METR \"METR\") showing that the length of tasks [frontier models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_model \"Frontier model\") are capable of executing at a 50% success rate has roughly doubled every 7 months from 2019 to 2024. The shaded region represents the 95% [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval \"Confidence interval\").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-4)\\n\\nSome scholars trace the conceptual roots of agentic AI to [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing \"Alan Turing\")\\'s mid-20th century work with machine intelligence and [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener \"Norbert Wiener\")\\'s work on feedback systems.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-CR-5) The term agent-based process management system was used as far back as 1998 to describe the concept of using autonomous agents for business process management.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-6) The psychological principle of agency was also discussed in the 2008 work of sociologist [Albert Bandura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Bandura \"Albert Bandura\"), who studied how humans can shape their environments.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-7) This research would shape how humans modeled and developed artificial intelligence agents.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-8)\\n\\nSome additional milestones of agentic AI include [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\")\\'s [Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer) \"Deep Blue (chess computer)\"), demonstrating how agency could work within a confined domain, advances in machine learning in the 2000s, AI being integrated into robotics, and the rise of generative AI such as [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI \"OpenAI\")\\'s [GPT models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer \"Generative pre-trained transformer\") and [Salesforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce \"Salesforce\")\\'s Agentforce platform.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-CR-5)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-9)\\n\\nIn the last decade, significant advances in AI have spurred the development of agentic AI. Breakthroughs in [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\"), [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\"), and [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_networks \"Neural networks\") allowed AI systems to learn on their own and make decision with minimal human guidance.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Consilience of agentic AI across autonomous transportation, industrial automation, and tailored healthcare has also supported its viability. [Self-driving cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car \"Self-driving car\") use agentic AI to handle complex road scenarios.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-10)\\n\\nIn 2025, research firm [Forrester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrester_Research \"Forrester Research\") named agentic AI a top [emerging technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technology \"Emerging technology\") for 2025.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n\\nApplications\\n------------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Applications\")]\\n\\nApplications using agentic AI include:\\n\\n*   Software development - [AI coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding \"Vibe coding\") agents can write large pieces of code, and review it. Agents can even perform non-code related tasks such as [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering \"Reverse engineering\") specifications from code.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Customer support automation - AI agents can improve customer service by improving the ability of [chatbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbots \"Chatbots\") to answer a wider variety of questions, rather than having a limited set of answers pre-programmed by humans.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Enterprise workflows - AI agents can automatically automate routine tasks by processing pooled data, as opposed to a company needing [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API \"API\") preprogrammed for specific tasks.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Cybersecurity and threat detection - AI agents deployed for [cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security \"Computer security\") can automatically detect and mitigate threats in real time. Security responses can also be automated based on the type of threat.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Business intelligence - AI agents can support [business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence \"Business intelligence\") to produce more useful analytics, such as responding to natural language voice prompts.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Real-world applications - agentic AI is already being used in many real-world situations to automate complex tasks, across industries, and therefore has been successfully deployed in many departments and organizations. Some of the examples are \\n    *   Manufacturing and predictive maintenance - Siemens AG uses agentic AI to analyze real-time sensor data from industrial equipment, predicting failures before they occur. Following the deployment of agentic AI in their operations, they reduced unplanned downtime by 25%.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-13)\\n    *   Finance and algorithmic trading - At JPMorgan & Chase they developed various tools for financial services, one being \"LOXM\" that executes high-frequency trades autonomously, adapting to market volatility faster than human traders.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-14)\\n\\nRelated concepts\\n----------------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Related concepts\")]\\n\\nAgentic automation, sometimes referred to as agentic process automation, refers to applying agentic AI to generate and operate workflows. In one example, large language models can construct and execute automated (agentic) workflows, reducing or eliminating the need for human intervention.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-15)\\n\\nWhile agentic AI is characterized by its decision-making and action-taking capabilities, [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_AI \"Generative AI\") is distinguished by its ability to generate original content based on learned patterns.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-NB-3)\\n\\n[Robotic process automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation \"Robotic process automation\") (RPA) describes how software tools can automate repetitive tasks, with predefined workflows and structured data handling.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-BB-2) RPA\\'s static instructions limit its value. Agentic AI is more dynamic, allowing unstructured data to be processed and analyzed, including contextual analysis, and allowing interaction with users.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-BB-2)\\n\\nSee also\\n--------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: See also\")]\\n\\n*   [Intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent \"Intelligent agent\")\\n*   [Model Context Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol \"Model Context Protocol\")\\n*   [Rational agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent \"Rational agent\")\\n*   [Software agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent \"Software agent\")\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: References\")]\\n\\n1.   ^ [Jump up to: _**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_ref-WE_1-0)[_**b**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_ref-WE_1-1)Miller, Ron (December 15, 2024).

The independent systems automatically respond to conditions, to produce process results. The field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems, when applied to process automation. Applications include [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development \"Software development\"), [customer support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_support \"Customer support\"), [cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity \"Cybersecurity\") and [business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence \"Business intelligence\").\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Overview\")]\\n\\nThe core concept of agentic AI is the use of _AI agents_ to perform automated tasks but without human intervention.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-WE-1) While [robotic process automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation \"Robotic process automation\") (RPA) and AI agents can be programmed to automate specific tasks or support rule-based decisions, the rules are usually fixed.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-BB-2) Agentic AI operates independently, making decisions through continuous learning and analysis of external data and complex data sets.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-NB-3) Functioning agents can require various AI techniques, such as [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing \"Natural language processing\"), [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning \"Machine learning\") (ML), and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision \"Computer vision\"), depending on the environment.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-WE-1)\\n\\nParticularly, [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\") (RL) is essential in assisting agentic AI in making self-directed choices by supporting agents in learning best actions through the trial-and-error method. Agents using RL continuously to explore their surroundings will be given rewards or punishment for their actions, which refines their decision-making capability over time. All the while [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\"), as opposed to [rule-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule-based_system \"Rule-based system\") methods, supports agentic AI through multi-layered neural networks to learn features from extensive and complex sets of data. RL combined with deep learning thus supports the use of AI agents to adjust dynamically, optimize procedures, and engage in complex behaviors with limited control from humans.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_]\\n\\nHistory\\n-------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: History\")]\\n\\n[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Measuring_AI_Ability_to_Complete_Long_Tasks.png/250px-Measuring_AI_Ability_to_Complete_Long_Tasks.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Measuring_AI_Ability_to_Complete_Long_Tasks.png)\\n\\nGraph from the nonprofit [METR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METR \"METR\") showing that the length of tasks [frontier models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_model \"Frontier model\") are capable of executing at a 50% success rate has roughly doubled every 7 months from 2019 to 2024. The shaded region represents the 95% [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval \"Confidence interval\").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-4)\\n\\nSome scholars trace the conceptual roots of agentic AI to [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing \"Alan Turing\")\\'s mid-20th century work with machine intelligence and [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener \"Norbert Wiener\")\\'s work on feedback systems.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-CR-5) The term agent-based process management system was used as far back as 1998 to describe the concept of using autonomous agents for business process management.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-6) The psychological principle of agency was also discussed in the 2008 work of sociologist [Albert Bandura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Bandura \"Albert Bandura\"), who studied how humans can shape their environments.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-7) This research would shape how humans modeled and developed artificial intelligence agents.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-8)\\n\\nSome additional milestones of agentic AI include [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM \"IBM\")\\'s [Deep Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer) \"Deep Blue (chess computer)\"), demonstrating how agency could work within a confined domain, advances in machine learning in the 2000s, AI being integrated into robotics, and the rise of generative AI such as [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI \"OpenAI\")\\'s [GPT models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer \"Generative pre-trained transformer\") and [Salesforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce \"Salesforce\")\\'s Agentforce platform.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-CR-5)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-9)\\n\\nIn the last decade, significant advances in AI have spurred the development of agentic AI. Breakthroughs in [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning \"Deep learning\"), [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning \"Reinforcement learning\"), and [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_networks \"Neural networks\") allowed AI systems to learn on their own and make decision with minimal human guidance.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\\\\_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_] Consilience of agentic AI across autonomous transportation, industrial automation, and tailored healthcare has also supported its viability. [Self-driving cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car \"Self-driving car\") use agentic AI to handle complex road scenarios.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-10)\\n\\nIn 2025, research firm [Forrester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrester_Research \"Forrester Research\") named agentic AI a top [emerging technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technology \"Emerging technology\") for 2025.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n\\nApplications\\n------------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Applications\")]\\n\\nApplications using agentic AI include:\\n\\n*   Software development - [AI coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding \"Vibe coding\") agents can write large pieces of code, and review it. Agents can even perform non-code related tasks such as [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering \"Reverse engineering\") specifications from code.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Customer support automation - AI agents can improve customer service by improving the ability of [chatbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbots \"Chatbots\") to answer a wider variety of questions, rather than having a limited set of answers pre-programmed by humans.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Enterprise workflows - AI agents can automatically automate routine tasks by processing pooled data, as opposed to a company needing [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API \"API\") preprogrammed for specific tasks.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Cybersecurity and threat detection - AI agents deployed for [cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security \"Computer security\") can automatically detect and mitigate threats in real time. Security responses can also be automated based on the type of threat.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Business intelligence - AI agents can support [business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence \"Business intelligence\") to produce more useful analytics, such as responding to natural language voice prompts.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-UC-11)\\n*   Real-world applications - agentic AI is already being used in many real-world situations to automate complex tasks, across industries, and therefore has been successfully deployed in many departments and organizations. Some of the examples are \\n    *   Manufacturing and predictive maintenance - Siemens AG uses agentic AI to analyze real-time sensor data from industrial equipment, predicting failures before they occur. Following the deployment of agentic AI in their operations, they reduced unplanned downtime by 25%.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-13)\\n    *   Finance and algorithmic trading - At JPMorgan & Chase they developed various tools for financial services, one being \"LOXM\" that executes high-frequency trades autonomously, adapting to market volatility faster than human traders.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-14)\\n\\nRelated concepts\\n----------------\\n\\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agentic_AI&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Related concepts\")]\\n\\nAgentic automation, sometimes referred to as agentic process automation, refers to applying agentic AI to generate and operate workflows. In one example, large language models can construct and execute automated (agentic) workflows, reducing or eliminating the need for human intervention.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-15)\\n\\nWhile agentic AI is characterized by its decision-making and action-taking capabilities, [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_AI \"Generative AI\") is distinguished by its ability to generate original content based on learned patterns.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-NB-3)\\n\\n[Robotic process automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation \"Robotic process automation\") (RPA) describes how software tools can automate repetitive tasks, with predefined workflows and structured data handling.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agentic_AI#cite_note-BB-2) RPA\\'s static instructions limit its value.
